The total [[area of Poland]] is {{convert|312679|km2|sqmi}},<ref name=\"CSO_2008\"\/> making it the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|69th largest country]] in the world and the 9th largest in Europe. Poland has a population of over 38.5&nbsp;million people,<ref name=\"CSO_2008\"\/> which makes it the [[List of countries by population|34th most populous country]] in the world<ref name=\"nationmaster\"\/> and the sixth most populous [[Member State of the European Union|member of the European Union]], being its most populous [[post-communist]] member. Poland is a [[unitary state]] made up of 16 [[voivodeships]]. Poland is a member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], the [[United Nations]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), [[European Economic Area]], [[International Energy Agency]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], [[European Space Agency]], [[G6 (EU)|G6]], [[Council of the Baltic Sea States]], [[Visegr\u00e1d Group]], [[Weimar Triangle]] and [[Schengen Agreement]]. \n\nThe establishment of a Polish state is often identified with the adoption of [[Christianity]] by its ruler [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] in 966,<ref name=\"A Concise History of Poland\"\/> over the territory similar to that of present-day Poland. The [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Kingdom of Poland]] was formed in 1025, and in 1569 it cemented [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian union|a long association]] with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] by signing the [[Union of Lublin]], forming the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The Commonwealth ceased to exist in 1795 as the [[Partitions of Poland|Polish lands were partitioned]] among the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the [[Russian Empire]], and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Old Austria]]. [[History of Poland (1918\u20131939)|Poland regained its independence]] as the [[Second Polish Republic]] in 1918. Two decades later, in September 1939, [[World War II]] started with the [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Soviet Union]] invasion of Poland ([[Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union|Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]]). Over six million Polish citizens died in the war. The [[People's Republic of Poland|People's Republic]] was declared in 1952 although Poland was a [[client state]] of the [[Soviet Union]] from the closing days of the war. During the [[Revolutions of 1989]], the [[communism|communist]] state was overthrown and democratic rule was re-established in the form of the current Poland, constitutionally known as the \"Third Polish Republic\".\n\nDespite [[Occupation of Poland (1939-1945)|the vast destruction the country experienced in World War II]], Poland managed to preserve much of its [[Culture of Poland|cultural wealth]]. There are currently 14 heritage sites inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Poland|World Heritage list in Poland]].<ref name=\"Poland \u2013 UNESCO World Heritage Centre\"\/> Since the end of the communist period, Poland has achieved a \"very high\" ranking in terms of [[Human Development Index|human development]].<ref name=\"Human Development Index and its components\"\/>"}]}}}}
